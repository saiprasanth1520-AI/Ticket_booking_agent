They are also super friendly and quick to respond. They also really take pride in their work. It wasn't just a job for them, they treat your home like it's art.

We couldn't be happier with the painting service we chose! From start to finish, the experience was fantastic. First off, their professional painters were incredibly friendly and easy to work with. They helped us pick the perfect colors for both rooms. The quality of the interior painting was top-notch, and you could tell they used high-quality paint. The whole process was stress-free and they finished on time, which we really appreciated. One thing that stood out was their attention to detail. They meticulously covered our furniture and floors, leaving no mess behind. If you're looking for a reliable service that offers apartment painting, residential painting, or just need room painting done right, we highly recommend them. They also offer great customer service and the pricing was very reasonable for the level of professionalism we received. We loved how they transformed our home; it feels so cozy and inviting now. If you need a painting company for your place, definitely give them a call. They truly offer the best home painting services we've experienced. Thank you for making our new apartment feel like home!"

From the start, the team was professional, on time, and super helpful when it came to picking the right colors and finishes for each room. I live in Manhattan, and it\u2019s not easy finding reliable painters who know how to work efficiently in spaces like mine \u2014 especially in areas like Harlem, Chelsea, Upper East Side, SoHo, and Lower Manhattan. But Click and Paint really came through. They prepped everything with care, covered all my furniture, and finished the job in just two days without cutting corners. The walls look flawless, the apartment feels brand new, and the whole process was smooth from quote to cleanup. I highly recommend Click and Paint to anyone looking for quality painting services with great customer care."

Adam was amazing from start to finish. He was communicative, sending us daily updates, including videos, from the condo as he and the team completed the work. This is all complemented by the fact that he\u2019s just an honest, good guy who loves helping people and is passionate about delivering what the customer wants. The price at the end was exactly what we agreed to in the beginning. No hidden fees, no surprises, just great service. I highly recommend Adam and By Hand Painting and will be using them in the future for any work we need on our Hoboken condo. THANK YOU Adam!"

Ryan is not only one of the kindest people you'll ever meet, but his work speaks for itself. When he came to give an estimate, his prices were fair and reasonable, and he clearly explained a breakdown on what would be included with the job. He worked really hard to stay within our budget and gave us options on how to do so. He and his team showed up on time every day, were meticulous and professional, and even went above their call, moving things that we forgot about and fixing little things that weren't originally included as they saw them. The most impressive thing for us was after they applied one coat of paint in one room, I (through my own fault of choosing poorly) didn't like the color. Without hesitation, Ryan told me he could change it, and it's no problem at all. I said I didn't want to do that to him, as he had just spent half a day priming and painting that room, and he simply said \"Don't worry about it. These things happen. You have to love your home. I'll go get another color. Just let me know which one.\" We, on our own, paid for the new paint and gave him a bit extra money for his time and trouble, but he never once asked for us to do that, nor expected it. Overall, we are beyond impressed with Ryan and his crew. In a world of price-gouging, mediocre work, and unreliable people, Ryan and his crew are diamonds in the rough on all counts. Highly recommend!"

Todd (the owner) of my local Certapro Painters of Staten Island, came and gave me a very reasonable price. They came an finished the job in 2 days. The paint team arrived punctually and did a great job. They covered everything to avoid paint splatters. They were neat and thorough on the job. The office stayed in touch with me throughout the entire project and Todd came each day to insure everything was being painted accurately and according to the written estimate I was given. I am very please with the outcome of my project and am very happy to be living back in my home. Don't hesitate to use Todd and CertaPro."

They\u2019re also reasonably priced compared to other companies in NYC. We were very pleased with their service and look forward to hiring them again for our future painting jobs!"

All in all the price was very fair and included the price of labor and the paint. He and his workers were always very punctual, polite, and professional. The work they did was well done and our walls look great. They left the house as clean as a job can be done. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to work with them again."
